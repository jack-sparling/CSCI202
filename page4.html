    <p>I have a dog, his name is Moose.</p>
    <p>He is 3 years old and very rambunctious.</p>
    <p>When he was young, we took him to swim.</p>
    <p>We threw him a stick and he sprinted to the water.</p>
    <p>But when he hit the water... PANIC!</p>
    <p>He flailed towards land, refusing to ever return to water.</p>
    <p>It took him over a year until finally we said enough.</p>
    <p>We got Moose a little pool to get comfortable with the water.</p>
    <p>It worked like a charm, and now he can swim like a pro!</p>
